This repository contains the analysis and insights on crime trends in West Africa from 1970 to 2020. The project focuses on various aspects such as fatalities, perpetrator groups, target types, weapon types, and geographical distribution of crimes. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns in the region and offer data-driven recommendations for improving security.

Contents:
Data: Raw and cleaned data files used for the analysis.
Scripts: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Visualizations: Charts, graphs, and maps illustrating key findings.
Reports: Detailed reports summarizing the analysis, observations, and recommendations.

Key Observations:
Top Country with Fatalities: Nigeria (29,093 fatalities)

Data-Driven Policies: Governments should leverage this data to formulate policies that address the specific needs of high-risk areas and allocate resources more effectively.

Education and Awareness: Raising awareness about the most dangerous weapon types and crime hotspots can empower citizens to take precautions and assist law enforcement agencies.
